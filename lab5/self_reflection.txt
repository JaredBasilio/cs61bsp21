You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Resize and wraparound were a lot more intuitive than my solution of a lot of if/else statements. My code
might have been cut to half of the lines I used if I took their approach.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Organization was nice and it is generallly readable and easy to explain.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: My resize, addFirst, and addLast had a lot of if statements that I was not sure if they would actually occur.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Use more helper methods that can be used often such as wrap around.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The individual node class which asked too many objects when initialization.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Some cases happen too frequently that they could be initialized in the class, such as null.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?
