8884. I'm a straight male who's masturbated constatly for years. Considering how much semen I've produced, it surprises many of my friends to hear that I've never tasted a drop of my own cum. I've tried others'; the first time I made a girl cum I lapped up a mouthful of the stuff, swallowed, and became a man. But in the brief microseconds it passed over my tongue it tasted absolutely awful, and maybe I should have kept my experiences in mind. So I got really really bored last night after finishing my homework, and decided to start a research project. Spoiler alert, mine didn't taste any better than my friend's that I was talking about. I really had no idea what I was thinking; it truly tasted mindblowingly terrible. I feel bad for anyone who feels obligated by a man to drink this stuff. In fact, looking back at my breakups I wonder if this was a factor. But I'm all about self-improvement-I did my research, and I'll be adding plenty of pineapple to my diet moving forward. Also I'll definitely offer chasers or mouthwash to my dates who do me this favor in the future. TL;DR don't taste your own cum, it's not worth it.
